  "description": "The HIPAA Security Rule is a federal regulation that sets national standards for\r\n            protecting individuals' electronic protected health information (ePHI). It mandates that covered entities\r\n            and their business associates implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the\r\n            confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI. The rule is designed to be flexible and scalable,\r\n            allowing organizations to assess their own risks and implement appropriate measures accordingly. Compliance\r\n            with the Security Rule helps prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents that\r\n            could compromise patient privacy and trust.",
