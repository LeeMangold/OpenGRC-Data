It mandates that covered entities and their business associates implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI. The rule is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing organizations to assess their own risks and implement appropriate measures accordingly. Compliance with the Security Rule helps prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents that could compromise patient privacy and trust.",
